This server was initially envisioned for use with [NeuroMCP](https://github.com/ECHO-HELLO-WORLD424/NeuroMCP) for relay purposes, however, the [NeuroPilot project](https://github.com/VSC-NeuroPilot/neuropilot) would also have a use for it as a registry and separated layer.
As such, the server was then developed to be a combined relay & registry, and also become application-agnostic.

  <Card title="Setup" icon="download">
    Set up the server for [local](/neuro-mcp-relay-registry/setup/local/) and/or
    [group](/neuro-mcp-relay-registry/setup/group/) uses. You can also get the
    server as a [Docker container](/neuro-mcp-relay-registry/setup/docker/).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Control/moderate" icon="approve-check">
    You decide what servers to connect and control what tools are exposed via a
    web UI.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agnostic to anything and everything" icon="external">
    Host it anywhere, use it with any AI app\*, and connect any server to it.
    This server is as agnostic as it can possibly be.

    So that you can bring any server, from any developer, made in any of those
    formats.

setup since they cannot access locally-hosted servers.
